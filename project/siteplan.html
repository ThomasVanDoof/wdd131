        <h1>PROJECT SITE PLAN</h1>
        <p>
            A while ago, I had an idea. A game. I made a compelling storyline, round characters, and many stats and interesting game mechanics. I then realized that I had no idea how to code. This website is a practice for my future game. I'm thinking that at least I can make the website to prepare for my game.
            Thats the history of it. The purpose of this website is to create an easy to traverse site that has all the information about the game, and to give a place for people to buy it when it is released. 
        </p>
        <h2>Scenario 1</h2>
        <p>
            Some of you may be asking: "isn't this just Battle Front 2, but recolored?" I laugh at that question. Yes. Yes it is. And that is because it was origionaly going to be a battlefront 2 fan game, then it started branching.  story grew! The world started shifting under my own two feet. A world molded affter my own imagination. A world that I could not just let go of. So I started making a game. A game that would be the game of my dreams.
        </p>
        <h2>Scenario 2</h2>

            Q: What is the game about?
            A: Click that purchase button to find out! Just kidding(though it would be a great idea). Click the About to find any past news about the game/what its about n' stuff. Or click the News button to find out about the latest news about the game.
